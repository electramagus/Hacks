# Spotify & YouTube Playlist Downloader

A powerful Python script that downloads songs from Spotify and YouTube playlists by searching for them on YouTube and saving them as high-quality audio files. Features a user-friendly interface, supports multiple playlists, and includes smart features like progress tracking and automatic retries.

> **Yes, [SpotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) exists. But I still built this ‚Äî because reinventing the wheel is how you learn to drive.**

## What Does This Script Do?
- Reads your Spotify playlist (public or private)
- Searches YouTube for each song
- Downloads the best match
- Saves all songs to a folder you choose
- If you stop the script, you can run it again and it will continue where it left off
- Downloads many songs at the same time for speed

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure your Spotify Developer application has the correct redirect URI

   - Try deleting the `.cache` file and re-authenticating

2. **FFmpeg Not Found**
   - Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - Add it to your system PATH or specify the full path in the config

3. **Download Failures**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try reducing the number of concurrent downloads
   - Increase the download delay if you're being rate-limited

4. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
